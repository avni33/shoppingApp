{"title" : "Shadow Princess", "description" :"The Mughal Empire has always held a fascination for English writers who have written novels based on the history of India. The rich display of pomp, splendour and luxury, the internal conflicts and fratricide, the intrigues and plottings among family members have all made for great stories. These elements have existed in all kingdoms and empires, but with the Mughals, they were very obvious and open.In Shadow Princess (Paperback), Indu Sundaresan paints a similar picture of the Mughals, but what sets her apart from other writers is that she mainly concentrates on the powerful females of the dynasty.
